Git Setup:

Create Repository, create folder and new vs project.
Then copy the hidden git folder into the vs project folder.
This is a quick way of creating a git repository that is not empty.

We've also set up a .gitignore folder
with
# Directories
and #Files

useful git commands

git diff
	I need to look into this for more diff options

git status

git reset .

git add *

git commit -m "Msg"

git push origin {Branch Name}
	so currently we're using git push origin main

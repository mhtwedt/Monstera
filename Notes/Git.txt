Git Setup:

Create Repository, create folder and new vs project.
Then copy the hidden git folder into the vs project folder.
This is a quick way of creating a git repository that is not empty.

We've set up a .gitignore folder
with
#Directories
#Files
which wont be pushed to the repository

a .gitmodules folder was created automatically
